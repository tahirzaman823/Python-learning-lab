# If-Else Conditional Statements

## What are Conditional Statements?

- Conditional statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions.
- Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making.

### Syntax

```python
if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition2 is True
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are False
```

### Example

```python
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just became an adult!")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")
```
