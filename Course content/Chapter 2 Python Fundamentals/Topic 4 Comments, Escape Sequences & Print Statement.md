# Comments, Escape Sequences & Print Statement

## Comments

- Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the Python interpreter.
- Single-line comments start with `#`.
- Multi-line comments are enclosed in `'''` or `"""`.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

'''
This is a
multi-line comment
'''
```

## Escape Sequences

- Escape sequences are used to include special characters in strings.
- Common escape sequences:
  - `\n`: Newline
  - `\t`: Tab
  - `\\`: Backslash
  - `\"`: Double quote
  - `\'`: Single quote
- Example:

```python
print("Hello\nWorld!")
print("This is a tab\tcharacter.")
```

## Print Statement

- The `print()` function is used to display output.
- You can use `sep` and `end` parameters to customize the output.

```python
print("Hello", "World", sep=", ", end="!\n")
```
